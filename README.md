🌿 Voice for Healing

AI Voice Chatbot for Grief Support (Concept Project)
Sponsor: Dr. Young

📌 Project Overview

Voice for Healing is a conceptual landing page exploring the design of an AI voice chatbot intended to support children experiencing grief, particularly those facing a parent’s serious illness (including hospice care) or coping after loss.
The project investigates how voice-based AI could:
Encourage emotional expression
Support memory sharing
Provide gentle reflective prompts
Offer structured, accessible grief support
This repository contains a publicly accessible landing page hosted via GitHub Pages.


🧠 The Problem

Children experiencing anticipatory grief (grieving before a loved one passes) often lack:
Developmentally appropriate support tools
Affordable ongoing emotional resources
Structured prompts to process complex emotions
Caregivers may struggle to start grief conversations, especially in hospice or terminal illness situations.
This project investigates whether a voice-based AI chatbot can help bridge that gap ethically and safely.


👥 Target Audiences

The website provides two versions:

🔵 Adult / Caregiver View
Includes:
Overview of the AI voice chatbot concept
Explanation of voice replication (with consent)
Set up flow (conceptual)
Ethical boundaries and safety considerations

🟣 Teen View (13+)
Includes:
Clear explanation of what the AI tool is
Emotional reflection prompts
Grounding exercises
Memory-sharing examples
Transparent reminder that the AI is not a real person

⚙️ How It Works (Conceptually)
The AI voice chatbot would:
Use conversational AI to guide reflection
Offer optional voice modeling (with caregiver consent)
Provide calming prompts and emotional check-ins
Support memory reservation and storytelling
The website itself is a static landing page presenting this concept.

🔐 Ethics & Safety Considerations

Because this project involves grief, children, and AI voice modeling, safety is central.
Design principles include:
Explicit caregiver consent
Clear disclosure that the AI is not the real person
No medical advice or therapeutic claims
Encouragement to seek trusted adults and professionals
Data minimization and privacy awareness
This project is exploratory and academic in nature.
