  <h1>AI Voice Chatbot for Grief Healing</h1>
  <p><strong>Sponsor:</strong> Dr. Young</p>

  <div class="section">
    <h2>The Problem</h2>
    <p>
      Children facing the loss of a parent due to illness or hospice care often
      experience anticipatory grief with limited emotional support tools.
      Traditional grief counseling is expensive, inaccessible, or not designed
      for children.
    </p>
  </div>

  <div class="section">
    <h2>The Idea</h2>
    <p>
      We propose an AI voice chatbot designed specifically for grief healing.
      The chatbot uses conversational AI and voice interaction to help children
      process emotions, share memories, and maintain a comforting connection
      with loved ones who are passing away or have passed.
    </p>

  <div class="section">
    <h2>How It Helps Children</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Supports grief before and after loss</li>
      <li>Encourages sharing memories and stories</li>
      <li>Provides emotional comfort through voice</li>
      <li>Accessible and affordable support</li>
    </ul>
  </div>

  <div class="section">
    <h2>Ethical Focus</h2>
    <p>
      The system prioritizes consent, parental involvement, and emotional safety.
      The AI is designed as a supportive tool, not a replacement for human care
      or therapy.
